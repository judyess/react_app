**Create a New App and Go Live by Uploading it to Netlify**
	("Works for any React 'front end' app")

1. Create folder for the project, then open in VSC
2. Run: $ npx create-react-app ./
	(The folder must be completely empty)
3. Run: $ npm build
4. In Netlify, Upload (just) the "build" folder that was just created.
	Netlify will create the website, then assign it some random nonsense URL. But that URL is live and actually online.
Done. App is live. Need to run "$ npm build" and reupload everytime any changes are made.


** Create a Github Repository for the webapp 
(to set up the project to automatically update the website when changes are made)
